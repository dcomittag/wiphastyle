When we talk about the village or the countryside, most of us will think about a place where people live a simple life and don't need to dress up nicely every day, e.g. women don't wear  nice makeup, men don't even shave  before leaving the house. But we all know the village life is not what everybody is looking for, some people love to live life in the city. A place where you can go out after a long week of hard work, a place where you can dress up nicely to go for a dance, having a date or meeting different kinds of people etc...

Back to my story. My name is Wipha, I was born in a small Thai village and my city life started when I had to move to study at college at 16 years of age. I was one of those girls who like to live in the city and love to style themselves. I followed the fashion trends as much as I could afford during my student life. I was inspired when I saw the brochures of business women who dress in business style, exchanging handshakes with smart good looking business men. That brochure had a big influence on me at my younger lifetime. I told myself every day to dress up beautifully, no matter what kind of activity I will do.

In the time of teenager, of course we were looking for attention from boys. Most girls will try to dress up as cute as they can to impress the boys and get their compliments when we just passed them. This way girls get more confident to walk outside and hang around with friends.

Well, I have only been talking about the girls' part of how we like to dress up to get attention from the boys. On the other side, I have always thought how about the boys? Do they know how they should dress up to impress girls? Do they care about it or are they interested to dress themselves up nicely? I do believe that most men do like to look good and dress well and also like to be complimented by a woman or people around them sometimes. After all, we are all human beings.

All the questions I had brought me to the Idea that I could dress a man to look smart casual and have his own style in a way he likes. So being a personal style consultant one of my challenges is to see a man feel confident with the clothes he's wearing. It makes me very happy when I can dress a man up and make him more successful. That first impression can boost his career or make him more successful with a woman he wants to date. I can guarantee a hundred percent that every woman loves to spend time going around with a confident man in style...
